->A real world map game
->To be controlled and managed by government
->Aimed at the idea of people helping each other
->Helping others will enable one to gain points
->At the end of each week or month people may be awarded 
  by the govt.
->This will ensure (or at least try to) the safety 
  of women, chidren and senior citizens
->Added advantage of reducing the craze around 
  PUBG and other such MMORG games
->Features must include Light Weight Voice Recognition 
  Software to recognize specific common words like "Help"
->This is probably possible with basic Machine Learning 
  techniques.
->In case net balance is nil, it should be able to call 
  for help nearby with the help of Bluetooth and Hot-Spot 
  facilities

THE PART WHERE PHYSICS COMES IN:
->The last point-->ability to create a large radius bluetooth 
  connection. This should be light weight and should only feature 
  basic requirements,i.e.,file transfer,etc not required
  We just need to make the connection with nearby devices and 
  be able to use their network services in turn.
